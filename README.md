# Expo Constants API Error: Device Information Unavailable

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the Expo Constants API.  The bug occurs when trying to access device-specific information, resulting in unexpected behavior or app crashes. The solution provides a robust way to handle potential errors and access the necessary data.

## Bug Description:

The Expo Constants API, used to retrieve device information (e.g., device ID, OS version), fails to return the expected data or throws an error.  This can happen due to improper initialization or incompatibility issues with the Expo SDK version.

## Solution:

The solution focuses on asynchronous operations and error handling.  It uses `async/await` to manage asynchronous calls and employs a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle potential errors, providing alternative mechanisms or fallback values if the initial attempt fails.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using Expo CLI (`expo start`).
4. Observe the console output for errors and the displayed device information.
